              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>I am a theoretical chemistry graduate student pursuing my Ph.D. at Stanford University.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about the evolving role of technology in our lives.<br/>
                I strongly believe that the human-computer interaction revolution provided by virtual/augmented reality
                and the smarter automated systems built on machine learning can enhance human creativity and productivity.</p>
                <p>In my research, I am seeking to make quantum chemistry more accessible to both the general public and new scientists.<br/>
                I am creating an immersive environment where anyone can interact with molecules in real-time with full quantum mechanically accuracy.
                My other work is focused on building a cloud-based distributed framework (built on Docker and Kubernetes) for GPU-accelerated electronic structure.
                <p>Outside of work, I am an avid reader, rock climber, gamer, and tech enthusiast.</p>
