Summary
{:.h2}

This paper was a review of the psychiatric disorders associated with Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), which is a fairly recently discovered neurodegenerative disease.
FXTAS is one of three known Fragile X disorders, which also include Fragile X Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS).

All three disorders are caused by a mutation in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (<i>FMR1</i>) gene on the X chromosome that causes an abnormally long sequence of CGG repeats.
FXTAS is classed as premutations and is characterized by 50 - 200 CGG repeats, while FXS has over 200 repeats.
Since the <i>FMR1</i> gene is located on the X chromosome, males are much more affected by FXTAS and FXS than females are;
however, females carriers of the premutation can develop FXPOI.


My Contributions
{:.h2}

The majority of the literature of FXTAS focuses on adult males since the sample size is much larger.
However, I did find and review 5 sources that studied the behavioral challenges faced by young boys with FXTAS,
and found 3 sources that studied young girls who were affected by FXPOI.
