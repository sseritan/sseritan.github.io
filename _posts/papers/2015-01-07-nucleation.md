## Stefan's Overview

This paper is about understanding how to control nucleation by using additives to modulate the interfacial free energy of the nucleus.

If you have read my [post on nucleation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /blog/2018-06-24-what-is-nucleation %}), then you may remember that the interfacial free energy is responsible for the barrier to nucleation. The idea here is
